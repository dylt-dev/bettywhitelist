    Thank you! <span class='starName'>{{ name }}</span> loves that you're thinking of them.

    Your choice was anonymous. If you would like to later take credit for it, remember this code ...
    <br><p>
    <b>{{token}}</b>
    <br><p>
    If you provide us this code later we can associate it with you.
    <br><p>
    (This system is a work in progress ... meanwhile, your anonymity is most important)
